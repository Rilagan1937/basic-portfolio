                    <p>My name is Reygie Ilagan.  I am very interested in programming.  I am thoroughly convinced that coding is something that I want to do.  I’ve been enjoying all of the activities that we have been doing in class.  I enjoy the challenge. I recognize the long and difficult road ahead</p>
                    <p>I don't have any background with anything it related.  I've only worked in finance and sales in the past.  Currently I manage an automotive group with a few freinds.  I feel like I've hit a dead end and need to pick up some new technical skills in order to stay relevant and competitive in my professional career.  I believe that programming is the missing set of skills that I need in order to break down some barriers.</p>
                    <p>As I do this first assignment, I’m finding out how coding can really frustrate you.  It’s starting to get a lot better though.  I get a great sense of fulfilment once I am able get to the correct solution.  It’s really rewarding.</p>
